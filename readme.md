Asynchronous Javascript allows code to run out of normal sequential flow.
This is accomplished with methods such as setInterval and setTimeout
Callback functions allow us to break this flow, but Promise allows
us to make our code more maintainable.

What is Promise?
    Promise is a sort of "ticket" that you can hold.
    Think of going to the DMV to get your license renewed.
    You get a ticket and wait to get to the counter
    And call your "function" so to speak.
